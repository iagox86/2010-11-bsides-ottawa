Title: The Nmap Scripting Engine: Making Nmap work for you! 


The Nmap Scripting Engine, or NSE, has brought Nmap's power to an unprecedented level. More than just a portscanner, Nmap's Scripting Engine has the speed and power to scan thousands of hosts in parallel, quickly and with amazing results. Whether building packets from the ground up (such as probing DHCP or finding sniffers) or using high-level protocols (such as MSRPC or AFS), NSE makes it easy. In this highly technical presentation, the audience will be introduced to some interesting NSE scripts, be shown in detail how they work, and learn how to write their own from scratch. Learn how to make Nmap work for you!
